# Plan: Print To Frame ERP

Progress tracker, overwritten in place. Work items and their details live in [docs/04_workflows/BACKLOG.md](docs/04_workflows/BACKLOG.md); the Milestone 1 handoff is [docs/HANDOFF_REPORT.md](docs/HANDOFF_REPORT.md).

## Milestone 1 (tag `v1.0.0`, 2026-09-27): audit to remediation, done
- [x] Investigation phases 1–6: architecture, GCP inventory, 16 module maps, cross-module triggers, per-module `CLAUDE.md`, security and workflow docs, 16 module reviews (`docs/02_modules/*/FINDINGS.md`)
- [x] Test suite: unit, API, component, rules (Firestore + Storage emulators), Playwright; CI on every PR (PR #4 onward)
- [x] Phase 7 remediation steps 1–6, 8.1, 8.2 (PRs #6–#57); 3.3/3.4d/3.5d, 4.1, 4.3, 7 and B6 moved to the backlog by the owner
- [x] Project folder moved to the repo root (#58); follow-up backlog written (#59)
- [x] Owner decisions DEC-1..9 answered and implemented (#61–#64, #66, #69, #70); Storage rules deployed live 2026-09-27
- [x] `staging` and `main` identical (last promotion #71 + milestone PR)

## Standing decisions
Keep the x0.25 invoice print scaling; lead stage advance stays manual; Managers may administer users (not Admins, not their own role); `users` readable by Admin, self, or roles with `agents:view` / `messages:view`; the Final-invoice guard is client-side `getExistingFinalInvoice`; live data is test data and a fresh environment is planned (DEC-5); default permissions everywhere (DEC-7).

## How each item runs
One item per fresh session: branch `claude/<topic>` from `staging` → tests first (seen failing) → change → `npm run lint`, `npm run test:all`, `npm run build` (+ `npm run test:e2e` when visible) → docs, module `CLAUDE.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` in the same PR → PR into `staging` → promote to `main` by PR with a merge commit when the owner says so. Live actions (rules deploys, `settings/permissions`, Vercel/Firebase config) only with the owner's go at that moment. Full detail: [GIT_WORKFLOW.md](docs/04_workflows/GIT_WORKFLOW.md), [TESTING.md](docs/04_workflows/TESTING.md).

## Roadmap to Milestone 2
- [ ] **Wave A, repo only, no live impact:** ~~MON-1~~, ~~MON-3~~, ~~MON-2~~, ~~SEC-1~~, ~~SEC-2~~, ~~SEC-3~~, SEC-9, TST-1, TST-3, FEA-3, FEA-8, FEA-6, FEA-11, ENG-4, ENG-5
- [ ] **Wave B, code + rules built and tested here, live with the next rules deploy:** MON-4, MON-5, MON-7, FEA-1, FEA-2, FEA-4, FEA-5, FEA-7, FEA-9, FEA-10, SEC-6, SEC-7, SEC-8
